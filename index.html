<h2> Syncope Panel </h2> 
<p> A syncope, commonly known as fainting, is a temporary loss of consciousness and muscle tone caused by a brief reduction in blood flow to the brain. This sudden and temporary loss of consciousness typically results from a drop in blood pressure, leading to a momentary interruption of oxygen and nutrient supply to the brain. Syncope episodes are often brief, lasting only a few seconds to a couple of minutes, and individuals usually recover spontaneously once blood flow is restored. Various factors, such as dehydration, low blood sugar, or sudden changes in body position, can contribute to the occurrence of syncope. </p>

<aside> <p>Blood types, classified by the presence or absence of certain antigens, play a critical role in blood transfusions and medical treatments. There are four main blood types: A, B, AB, and O, each with positive or negative Rh factors. Compatibility for blood transfusions relies on matching donor and recipient blood types to prevent adverse reactions. For instance, type O negative blood is considered the universal donor because it lacks A and B antigens and the Rh factor, making it safe for transfusion to individuals of any blood type. Conversely, AB positive blood is the universal recipient, as it contains no antibodies against A, B, or Rh antigens, allowing it to receive blood from any type without causing a reaction. Additionally, blood types may respond differently to environmental factors and diseases. For instance, individuals with type O blood might have a lower risk of certain diseases like heart disease but may be more susceptible to severe forms of malaria due to the presence of specific antigens on red blood cells. </p> </aside>
